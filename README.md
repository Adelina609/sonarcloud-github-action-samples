This repository contains a few sample projects that show how to configure source code analysis from [GitHub Actions](https://developer.github.com/actions/).

Configuration depends on the build tool:

* See the [`maven` branch](https://github.com/sonarsource/sonarcloud-github-actions-samples/tree/maven) for Maven projects.
* See the [`generic` branch](https://github.com/sonarsource/sonarcloud-github-actions-samples/tree/generic) for projects that use other build tools (PHP, Python, COBOL, PL/SQL, ...).
